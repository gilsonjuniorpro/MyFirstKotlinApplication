# My first kotlin application

**It’s time to start using a modern programming language**.

I want to tell you about a new programming language called **Kotlin** and why you should consider it for
your next project. I used to prefer **Java** but now I'm very excited about coding Kotlin and at this
point I really can’t think of a situation where Java would be a better choice.

It’s developed by **JetBrains**, and the fact that these are the people behind a suite of IDEs, such as
**IntelliJ** and **WebStorm**, really shines through in Kotlin. It’s pragmatic and concise, and makes
coding a satisfying and efficient experience.
